# Tic_Tac_Toe_Game


Overview:
Tic-Tac-Toe, also known as Noughts and Crosses, is a classic two-player game where the objective is to form a straight line of three of one's own marks in a 3x3 grid. The game is simple yet offers strategic depth and is a great introduction to basic game theory and AI algorithms.

How to Play
The game is played on a 3x3 grid.
One player is "X" and the other player is "O".
Players take turns placing their marks in an empty square.
The first player to get three of their marks in a row (vertically, horizontally, or diagonally) wins.
If all nine squares are filled and neither player has three in a row, the game is a draw.
